  <p>
    A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do
    them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a <br>
    superhero,<b> need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal
    human being could possess </b>, and you need to use <br>
    that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman
    could be considered a superhero. <br>
    For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular
    police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a <br>
    good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a
    superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal <br>
    human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a
    superhero.
